The Movie Finder App is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows users to search for movies and TV shows using the TVmaze API. 
It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter a movie or show name, view detailed information including the title, image, and summary, and easily add selected items to a Favorites section for quick access.
The app also allows users to remove items from their favorites, offering a personalized experience. 
Designed with responsiveness in mind, the layout adapts well to both desktop and mobile devices. 
This project was created to practice working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and enhancing UI/UX through clean design and interactive features.
